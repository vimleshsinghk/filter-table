## Install and build project:

`npm install`
`npm start`

An example of what we want to achive is in the /build/ folder.

## Create an entity table and filter components

## TODO:
    1. Entity table
        - initially display all entities in the table
        - React table is already in the project (see https://react-table.js.org/#/story/readme)
        - the entities data is in src/App.js
    2. Filters
        - print the list of industries as filters
        - add a checkbox to each filter
        - when clicking on a filter, filter the entities in the table
        - multiple filters can be selected, the table should show entities that match either filter selected
        - style the selected filters with a highlight
        - edit the css and html to style the filters less as buttons and be more in line with the table (bg colour white, slight grey border, slight grey hover background)
    3. Page Layout
        - layout the page in two columns: left hand side for filters, right hand side for the table
        - the project already includes https://react-bootstrap.github.io and is ready to use for layouts (see https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/grid/)

All styles can be added to src/App.css.
